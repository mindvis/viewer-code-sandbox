# 3D Viewer Sandbox

This project is a sandbox environment focused on 3D viewer functionality. It is built with **React** and **TypeScript** and does not have any backend. The primary purpose of this sandbox is to experiment with and modify 3D viewer code in an isolated environment.

## Project Overview

The codebase is organized to allow easy experimentation with 3D viewer components. There are currently two main files where the 3D viewer code is implemented. To make changes, you will likely be working within these files.

## Files to Modify

- `src/pages/leftviewer.tsx`
- `src/pages/threedviewer.tsx`

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies with:
   ```bash
